An Economics Engine in Go

Based on _Emergent Economies for Role Playing Games_ by Jonathon Doran and Ian Parberry - [you can find the paper here](http://larc.unt.edu/techreports/LARC-2010-03.pdf)

Inspired by the excellent article on Gamasutra - _BazzarBot: An Open-Source Economics Engine_ by Lars Doucet - [you can find the article here](http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/LarsDoucet/20130603/193491/BazaarBot_An_OpenSource_Economics_Engine.php)

--------------
* There's an imbalance in how the agents are deciding to choose their bids - causing blacksmiths to always win out.  It definitely needs more tuning - and likely a better AI for the individual agents.
* This project is on the very backest of burners.
